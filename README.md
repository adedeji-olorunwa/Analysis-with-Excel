## Problem statement

Task 1.  I created a table with 20 rows of information which shows the following fields below:  

Employee ID, Employee Full Name, Department (Communications, Sales, I.T), Salary (between $5000 to $25000), Job type (Part-time, Freelance, Contract) 

I duplicated the worksheet 1 into worksheet 2 and worksheet 3 

Task 2.  In worksheet 1, I showed only employees who are â€˜Freelancersâ€™ and highlighted the ones whose salaries are above $10000.

Task 3.  In worksheet 2, I split the employee's full names into first name and last name, Checked for duplicates enteries and highlighted it out. 

Task 4.  In worksheet 3, I highlighted employees whose names begin with the letter â€˜Eâ€™ (in yellow). I formatted the Salary column such that the highest SALARY has a green background, and the lowest SALARY has a red background.
